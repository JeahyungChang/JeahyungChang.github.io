<h3> The Color Changing Button Update #4</h3>
</post>

<div class="box">Box</div>

<post>
<p> Today I found a cool website showing how to create animated buttons. I might try to implement it when I get the chance. No one really uses hyperlink buttons anymore. At the moment I'm having trouble mostly because the margins aren't working the way I want them to. <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/">Link to source</a>

<h3> Some Changes and Discussion of Upcoming Goals Update#3</h3>
<p> Biggest change added was probably the style of the updates, now it looks a bit more like a blog, which it kind of is. Here are some updates I hope to cover in the near future:<ul>
  <li>Rework design to make it more aesthetic</li>
  <li>Add a bit of javascript</li>
  <li>Any form of animation would be nice</li>
  <li>I probably should add some pictures also</li>
</ul> 
For starters here is a picture of a cat

<h3>The Start of Everything: Update#1</h3>
<p>This is the start to a wonderful journey. There might not be much here but this single post but hopefully I'll work on this site overtime. It took me forever just to figure out how to upload this site onto github. My overall vision for this site is to one day make it as sophisticated as some of the designer/templates sites. Tbh I'm salty people just click on a template button but fail to realize the struggle of actually coding in html and then proceed to brag about their site. At least when I'm done with this I'll have bragging rights</p>
